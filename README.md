### <a name="tell-me-about-yourself"></a>1. Tell me about yourself
I'm Neeraj Kumar. I have recently completed my Master’s in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in December 2024.

I began my professional journey at MAQ Software as an Associate Software Engineer, where I worked on Power Apps components, Power BI dashboards, and SQL optimization. Then I joined MTX Group, working on Salesforce development, API optimization, and workflow automation.

After that, I was a Software Development Engineer at Bumblebee Spaces, which involved more Workflow automation, Lightning Web Components optimization, and AWS integration with Salesforce.

### <a name="walk-me-through-your-resume"></a>2. Walk me through your resume
While working at Bumblebee Spaces, I was working on a project where we were developing Smart Home Installation Inventory Management Systems. The goal was to create a real-time web platform for customers and internal teams to monitor inventory, request maintenance, and manage inventory installations. I worked on the UI to handle customer requests regarding maintenance, installations, etc. On the backend, we used AWS Kafka for real-time updates and inventory live tracking.

At MTX, we worked on the MO DPR Project. Users can apply for business licenses across various industries (e.g., healthcare, chiropractic, dental, barber, etc.). The system handles background checks, and if approved, users get the license. I worked on LWC, Vlocity components, Apex, Aura, Security policies, and bulkifying triggers.

At MAQ, I worked on Power BI dashboards for analyzing client relationships and business decisions, as well as optimizing SQL queries using normalization and indexing.

At MAQ Software, I developed Power BI dashboards for clients across various industries to support data-driven decision-making. One of the key projects involved building interactive dashboards for customer engagement analysis, tracking client interactions, activity trends, and data exchange rates.

I also worked on financial performance dashboards to track revenue trends, costs, and profitability across regions. Additionally, I built a sales and marketing analytics dashboard that monitored lead conversion rates, campaign effectiveness, and customer retention metrics.

### <a name="what-challenge-did-you-face"></a>8. What challenge did you face?
At MAQ, I was given the task to explore Power BI in just two weeks. Soon after, I was assigned to a project that involved Power Apps, which I had no prior experience with. Initially, I was confused and didn't know where to start, but I reached out to a senior colleague and utilized online resources like Udemy, Coursera, YouTube, Reddit, and Stack Overflow. In just 3-4 days, I gained enough understanding to complete the tasks. This experience was challenging but boosted my confidence and taught me how quickly I can adapt to new technologies.
