# Tell me about yourself

I'm Neeraj Kumar. I have recently completed my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in December 2024. 

I began my journey at MAQ Software as an Associate Software Engineer, where I developed reusable Power Apps components, built interactive dashboards in Power BI, and optimized SQL queries for improved data efficiency. Additionally, I implemented automated testing frameworks, reducing defect rates by 40%.

Moving to MTX Group, I worked as a Consultant Trainee, where I focused on Salesforce development with advanced LWCs, API optimization, and workflow automation, improving system performance by 30%. I also contributed to security enhancements, CI/CD integration, and Agile execution, ensuring smoother project workflows.

At Bumblebee Spaces, my role as a Software Development Engineer involved automating workflows, optimizing LWCs, and integrating Salesforce with AWS services like Lambda and API Gateway. A key achievement was implementing real-time data streaming using AWS Kafka, which significantly reduced system latency.

Working with Salesforce at Bumblebee Spaces and MTX Group has been a journey of discovery and growth, and the more I explored its potential, the more it solidified my path toward building a future in this technology.
