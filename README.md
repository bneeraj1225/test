# Tell me about yourself

I'm Neeraj Kumar. I have recently completed my Master’s in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in December 2024. 

I began my journey at MAQ Software as an Associate Software Engineer, where I developed reusable Power Apps components, built interactive dashboards in Power BI, and optimized SQL queries for improved data efficiency. 

Moving to MTX Group, I worked as a Consultant Trainee, where I focused on Salesforce development with advanced LWCs, API optimization, and workflow automation, improving system performance by 30%. I also contributed to security enhancements, CI/CD integration, and Agile execution, ensuring smoother project workflows.

At Bumblebee Spaces, my role as a Software Development Engineer involved automating workflows, optimizing LWCs, and integrating Salesforce with AWS services like Lambda and API Gateway. A key achievement was implementing real-time data streaming using AWS Kafka, which significantly reduced system latency.

Working with Salesforce at Bumblebee Spaces and MTX Group has been a journey of discovery and growth, and the more I explored its potential, the more it solidified my path toward building a future in this technology.


### Why Did You Leave MTX Group?

I left MTX Group to pursue my Master’s in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, as I wanted to expand my technical skill set and gain deeper expertise in cloud computing, data analytics, and AI-driven technologies.

During my master’s program, I worked on projects involving Apache Spark, predictive analytics, and large-scale data processing, which helped refine my problem-solving skills and technical capabilities. Now that I have completed my degree, I am eager to apply my enhanced technical knowledge and consulting experience in a role that allows me to contribute meaningfully to enterprise digital transformation initiatives at MTX Group.

### Why do you want to rejoin MTX?

I chose to return to MTX because of the amazing work culture and supportive environment. The team hierarchy is well-structured, making problem-solving smooth and efficient, and collaboration across teams feels effortless. One thing I really appreciated was the access to learning resources like Coursera, which helped me grow my skills. MTX also values its employees, recognizing and rewarding hard work, which keeps motivation high. Plus, the managerial support was exceptional—high-level managers were always approachable and genuinely invested in helping us succeed. My experience here was both rewarding and inspiring, and I’m excited to be part of this team again.

### What are your career goals in the next 3-5 years?

Over the next 3-5 years, I aim to become a Solution Architect or Senior Consultant, specializing in Salesforce, cloud computing, and data-driven business transformation. I plan to earn Salesforce and AWS certifications to deepen my expertise in enterprise SaaS solutions.

MTX Group’s focus on cutting-edge technologies and strategic consulting provides an ideal environment for me to grow as a consultant, take on leadership responsibilities, and contribute to large-scale digital transformation projects.
