# Tell me about yourself

I'm Neeraj Kumar. I have recently completed my Master’s in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in December 2024. 

I began my professional journey at MAQ Software as an Associate Software Engineer, soo.. there I worked on Power Apps components, some Power BI dashboards, and SQL optimization. Then I joined MTX Group working on Salesforce development, API optimization, and some workflow automation.

After that I was a Software Development Engineer at Bumblebee Spaces which involved some more Workflow automation, Lightning Web Components optimization, and AWS integration with salesforce.

### Walk me through your resume:

While working at Bumblebee spaces, I was working on a project where we were developing Smart Home Installation Inventory Management Systems, The goal was to create a real time web platform for customers and internal teams to monitor inventory, request maintenance and mange inventory installations. I worked on UI, where they handle the customer requests regarding maintenance, installations etc. And in backend we used AWS Kafka for real time updates and also ensuring the inventory live tracking updates.

then coming to MTX, we worked on MO DPR Project, Here in this project users can apply for business licenses where there will be a lot of lienses like healthcare, chiropracticioner, dentist, Barber, etc, So, there will be a background check and if they approve they will get the business license. I worked on LWC, Vlocity components, Apex, Aura, Security policies and bulkifying triggers.

And at MAQ, I worked on a couple of power bi dashboards to analyze our organization client relation and business decisions, and optimizing some SQL queries using techniques like Normalization, Indexing.


### Where did you use PowerBI and tell me about your experience with it?

At MAQ Software, I worked on developing Power BI dashboards for clients across various industries, focusing on data-driven decision-making. One of the key projects I worked on involved building interactive dashboards for customer engagement analysis. These dashboards were built to look at client interactions, activity trends, and data exchange rates between different platforms.

Additionally, I developed financial performance dashboards that helped businesses track revenue trends, cost breakdowns, and profitability across different regions. Also, a dashboard on sales and marketing analytics, where I created reports to monitor lead conversion rates, campaign effectiveness, and customer retention metrics.

### Why Did You Leave MTX Group?

I wanted to pursue my Master’s in Computer Science , as I wanted to expand my technical skill set and gain deeper expertise in cloud computing, data analytics, and AI-driven technologies, which I believe could boost my strength in technical aspects. So, I had to put a break to my professional carrer to achieve the same.

### Why do you want to rejoin MTX?

I would say mostly because of the aspects like amazing work culture and supportive environment which I believe are crucial for an employee to survive in an organization. Also, I was captured with the well-structured hierarchy and collaboration across teams which promotes work to be accomplished effortlessly. When I was at MTX, I really liked their reward and recognition system for employees—it’s something you don’t see in a lot of companies these days. They also cared about continuous learning, giving us access to platforms like Coursera so we could upskill while working.
Overall, MTX wasn’t just a workplace—it was a space where employees felt valued, supported, and constantly encouraged to grow, making it a truly rewarding experience.

### What are your career goals in the next 3-5 years?

Over the next 3-5 years, I aim to become a Solution Architect or Senior Consultant, specializing in Salesforce, cloud computing, and data-driven business transformation. I plan to earn Salesforce and AWS certifications to deepen my expertise in enterprise SaaS solutions.

### What do you know about MTX Group?

MTX Group is a global technology consulting firm that focuses on digital transformation. They use cloud computing, AI, and data analytics to help businesses improve decision-making, streamline processes, and enhance customer experiences. They collaborate with companies like Google Cloud and Salesforce to deliver SaaS solutions across industries such as healthcare, finance, and public services. I'm particularly interested in their Early Career Program, which offers training in business consulting, Salesforce development, and data-driven decision-making—areas that align perfectly with my career goals.


### What challenge did you face?

At MAQ, They gave me a task where I had to explore Power BI in just two weeks. After that, I was assigned to a project that involved Power Apps, a tool I had never worked with before. At first, I was confused and didn’t know where to start. I then reached out to a senior colleague and also took help from some online resources like Udemy, Coursera, Youtube, Reddit, Stackoverflow to learn about Power Apps. In about 3-4 days, I was able to learn enough to complete my tasks. This experience was challenging, but it helped boost my confidence and showed me that I can quickly adapt to new technologies.


### Why should we hire you?

Working with Salesforce at Bumblebee Spaces and MTX Group has been a journey of discovery and growth, and the more I explored its potential, the more it solidified my path toward building a future in this technology. So I can say that this role aligns best with my interest and expertise.

Also During my master’s program, I worked on projects involving Apache Spark, predictive analytics, and large-scale data processing, which helped refine my problem-solving skills and technical capabilities. Now that I have completed my degree, I am eager to apply my enhanced technical knowledge and consulting experience in a role that allows me to contribute meaningfully to enterprise digital transformation initiatives at MTX Group.


### Why are you transitioning from a Developer to a QA/BA role?

As a developer, I was already involved in testing the features I built, and I realized I really enjoy that part of the process. The idea of understanding what stakeholders need and gathering those requirements is something that excites me. I also find the analysis of those requirements really interesting, so I see this role as a great opportunity to dive deeper into that and contribute in a new way.
