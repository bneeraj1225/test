# Tell me about yourself

I'm Neeraj Kumar. I have recently completed my Master’s in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in December 2024. 

I began my professional journey at MAQ Software as an Associate Software Engineer, soo.. there I worked on Power Apps components, some Power BI dashboards, and SQL optimization. Then I joined MTX Group working on Salesforce development, API optimization, and some workflow automation.

After that I was a Software Development Engineer at Bumblebee Spaces which involved some more Workflow automation, Lightning Web Components optimization, and AWS integration with salesforce.


### Why Did You Leave MTX Group?

I wanted to pursue my Master’s in Computer Science , as I wanted to expand my technical skill set and gain deeper expertise in cloud computing, data analytics, and AI-driven technologies, which I believe could boost my strength in technical aspects. So, I had to put a break to my professional carrer to achieve the same.

### Why do you want to rejoin MTX?

I would say mostly because of the aspects like amazing work culture and supportive environment which I believe are crucial for an employee to survive in an organization. Also, I was captured with the well-structured hierarchy and collaboration across teams which promotes work to be accomplished effortlessly. When I was at MTX, I really liked their reward and recognition system for employees—it’s something you don’t see in a lot of companies these days. They also cared about continuous learning, giving us access to platforms like Coursera so we could upskill while working.
Overall, MTX wasn’t just a workplace—it was a space where employees felt valued, supported, and constantly encouraged to grow, making it a truly rewarding experience.
